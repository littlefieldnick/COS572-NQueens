# COS572-NQueens

## Overview: N-Queen Problem
The N-Queen problem attempts to placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. A solution thus requires no two queens share the same column, row, or diagonal.

## Solution
One way to solve the N-Queens problem is by treating it as a constraint satisfaction problem. In a constraint satisfaction problem, there are three components:
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X"> a set of variables <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\{X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n\}">
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=D"> a set of domains <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\{D_1, D_2, \cdots, D_n\}">
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C"> a set of constraints that specify allowable combination of values <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\{C_1, C_2, \cdots, C_n\}">

A domain <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=D_i"> is a set of allowable values for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_i">. Each constraint consists of a paired value <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(scope, rel)"> where scope is the set of variables particpating in a constraint and rel is a relationship indicating all the values the constraints can take. CSPs will attempt to assign values to the variables in a way that doesn't violate any of the constraints. A solution that doesn't violate any constraints is considered complete. 

In the N-Queens problem:
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\{X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n\}"> correspond to the individual queens
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\{D_1, D_2, \cdots, D_n\}"> corresponds to values it can take which is a position in the row of the board (ranging from 1 to N)
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\{C_1, C_2, \cdots, C_n\}">: 
1.) No two queens share a column 
2.) No two queens share a row
3.) No two queens share a diagonal

To solve the CSP problem the min-conflicts algorithm can be used. The algorithm starts with a possible solution to the N-Queens problem. If all the constraints are satisfied then the current representation of the CSP is the final solution. If not, then we loop for a max number of steps in an attempt to resolve the conflicts. We do this by randomly choosing a variable that has conflicts. We find a new position that has the minimum number of conflicts and move the queen to that spot, and repeat until a solution is found or we have iterated the max number of steps. 



## Running the Code

When running the code the default is to run the 8-Queens problem. This can be run using the following command:

```
python3 nqueens_csp.py 
```

To run with a different value of N, the command is:

```
python3 nqueens_csp.py --nqueen NQUEEN
```

When NQUEEN is the value of N. For example, to run the 10-Queen problem, the command is

```
python nqueens_csp.py --nqueen 10
```
